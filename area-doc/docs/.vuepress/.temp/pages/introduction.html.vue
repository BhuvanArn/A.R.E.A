<p>The Action REAction project, or Area, is a 3rd year project at Epitech. The duration of the project was 8 weeks. The project was developed by a team of 5 students. The goal of this project is to create an application that allows users to set up actions and reactions for different services.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>An application server</strong> (backend)</li>
<li><strong>a web application</strong> (frontend)</li>
