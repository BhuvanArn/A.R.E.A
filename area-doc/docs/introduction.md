## What is the Area project ?

The Action REAction project, or Area, is a 3rd year project at Epitech. The duration of the project was 8 weeks. The project was developed by a team of 5 students. The goal of this project is to create an application that allows users to set up actions and reactions for different services.

The software is devided in three parts:
- **An application server** (backend)
- **a web application** (frontend)
- **a mobile application** (frontend).

Each user can create an account and connect different services to the application. The user can then create actions and reactions components for these services. The application triggers AREA automatically thanks to triggers.

## Techinical stack

### Backend

For the backend, we used the following technologies:
- **Rust** for the routing

- **PostgreSQL** for the database

### Frontend

For the client and the mobile client, the main technology is **Vue.js**.
